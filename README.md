# microfluidic_mdot

The photodetection scripts found in microfluidic_mdot take a video recording of the microfluidic plug flow from a *.WMV format,
converts it into a *.TIF stack for analysis, and runs signal generation and analysis on the *.TIF stack. A new iteration of this
code is planned, which will directly integrate video feed from the camera into LabVIEW and process microfluidic flow in realtime

The codes should be run in the following order:

1. Generate a *.WMV file from recording plug flow.
2. Use VidSwap.m to transcode the *.WMV file into a *.TIF stack for processing
3. Run mr_imagesort.m to generate a signal based on the *.TIF stack. This requires that the *.TIF file being analyzed is in the 
   same folder as the Detector.tif image. A simple detector was created in ImageJ and is outlined in the paper.
4. Run Oil_Water_Slug.m to analyze the signal generated by mr_imagesort.m. This will generate a duty cycle and plug velocity.
   Error analysis can be performed on your data at this point.
   
   
Please feel free to forward any feedback to my GitHub address. I'll answer any questions I can as quickly as I can. Thanks very
much for your interest in my research in engineering education in the microfludics realm!
